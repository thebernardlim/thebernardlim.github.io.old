excerpt: I used to be an avid runner. Here are a couple of experience pointers I learnt through my running journey that you can use to help improve your running performance
---

Mentally depict running, and one who had never do running as a sport in itself would think running is an easy sport. Just tie up your shoelaces and accelerate till finish line. Right? Not exactly. 

A couple of years ago, I decided to sign up for one of the running races (a trend that was mushrooming back during that time) as everyone was signing up. Before that, I had yet to run except during basketball. My main sport was basically basketball at that time.

I signed up for a 7 km run, and decided to use a treadmill at my aunt's place a couple of days before to 'prep' myself up for the weekend's race. That was one of the worst experiences ever. My world was spinning, and took me probably an hour and a half to finish 7 km. Totally appalling for someone in their early 20s with a lean figure and who does sports occasionally.

That experience however sparked an interest in me in this sport. I took it as a challenge to explore, learn and eventually fell in love with this sport. I eventually ended up winning a couple of running honors (just within Corporate category though), and thought I can share a thing or two which would help fellow aspiring runners.

#Ways to run faster

###1: Get a running app/watch to track progress.
The obvious number 1 rule of getting better at running will be this one. How does one know if one is already fast or not if his/her running times are not tracked! I personally love and recommend 'Runtastic', as it can sync your results to your account (Hence not a problem if you change phones), its pretty accurate, has important stats recorded and even includes a map of your running route (along with elevation measurements etc). 

###2: Safe running techniques
When I first picked up running, in order to be faster, I thought widening my running stride and cadence will speed up my times, as that is plain Physics. True. My times went up, but injuries came about too. Widening your running stride from your natural stride will only add more impact to your knee joints. 

The most recommended safe running technique is to always run with both feed below your body. Hence, small steps running. Will probably look not as cool, but trust me it will save your legs. To increase speed, simply increase cadence but maintain stride. Same result, but healthier legs!

###3: Proper shoes
We have a couple of feet types, namely normal, flat, and high arch foot types. Hence we actually do have different shoe types for different feet! Which explains the various shoe subtypes each reputable running brand usually has.

It is important to choose the correct shoe for correct feet else injuries will happen. I personally have slightly pronated feet hence I would require slightly heavier aka 'mid -stability' running shoes. 

You would probably think naturally we need to choose the lightest weight shoes to run the fastest, but thats not entirely true due to the above facts.

###4: Muscle maintenance. Myofascial release

I had an annoying niggling issue called the IT Band Syndrome.  I regularly went to physios. Bought running accessories specialised to fix the pain during runs, but none worked as effectively as using myofascial release on my legs!

The concept of myofascial release is to apply pressure to pressure points, knots in the aim of relaxing the surrounding tissue/muscles. Knots occasionally occur during muscle breakdown and repair. Think of knots as crumpling up your blanket using your fists. The surrounding blankets will become tighter hence in the human body, that specific muscle will become tight, leading to pain. 

One can accomplish myofascial release by using either foam rollers, PVC, lacrosse balls on the respective areas. Main areas for runners include the whole thigh (side, front) and hamstrings, calves, muscle surrounding shins and also the glutes/buttocks. 

Core work. Planks. Glute strength. Clam exercise. Box step ups. Lunges.

###5: Diet

Carbs! 

Go for same diet pre-running. Not too much water pre-running. Side stitch. Hydration. Energy Gels

###6: The Mind

Set 'checkpoint' goals. Examples: Speed per km for this upcoming km. 

###7: Your posture

Relaxed muscles (Shoulders, cheeks)
Relaxed fists. Slightly 90 degrees.
Relaxed ankles.  
Small steps. Cadence varies according to your abilities.
Try to get 'soundless' steps. Remember impact of each step.
Gaze at a 60 degree angle. Not too up ahead.
Lean slightly forward to use a bit of help from gravity. 

###8: Stick to your pace

Ignore what's around you. Never follow anyone else's pace or you will gas out and destroy your performance.

###9: Make it enjoyable

Favorite music. Play a track that will pump your adrenaline for the final stretch of the route.

Invest in awesome colored tshirts, and cool shoes, socks or accessories.

Run a new route.

###10: Patience
In order to succeed in running or any discipline in life per say, we need to understand progress takes time. Every mini progress should be appreciated, not overlooked and be used as signs that we are doing things right. 

###11: Regular consistent training

Consistency is key. Taking prolonged absence in between runs will 'reset' your legs. Legs will feel heavier, breathing laboured, route seems to take forever the next time you run. 

###12: Breathing

Consistent breathing. Getting your heart rate up way too high, and shallow breathing early in runs are recipes for disaster. Mouth goes dry quickly. Increased chance of side stitches. Mentally tough to sustain such an experience.


###Myth &#35;1: Running is boring <br/>
**Truth:** Definitely not. Running takes you to places. Taking in the different smells and sights of places that you run past is definitely more fun than being in aircon or within your house. We have had too much of that. Running also brings a state of solitude to the runner. There is calmness, and the fact that you can run and sweat it out is an awesome feeling (also classically known as the 'Runner's High'). Besides, keeping yourself fit in regular runs means you can actually run during your travels which is an exciting and different way to explore a  new city or new country.

###Myth &#35;2: Running is harmless <br/>
**Truth:** Unfortunately not. I have had my fair share of injuries from running and had learned that though running has a ton of benefits, it does bring a couple of harms as well if not done properly. 

###Myth &#35;3: Only some people can run fast. <br/>
